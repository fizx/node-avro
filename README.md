node-avro
---------

This was intended to be an addon for node, but there are a few problems with the
current status of this project:

  - avro does not have a complete c++ implementation
  - avro's c is written poorly, and would require a partial/full re-write to properly compile under g++
  - documentation/community is lacking (from what I saw)

So I'm putting this on the burner furthest back on the stove, and moving on.  
I think Google's Protocol Buffers is an excellent alternative.
